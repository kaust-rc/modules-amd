SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) consists of the following five solvers:

CVODE 	solves initial value problems for ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems.
CVODES 	solves ODE systems and includes sensitivity analysis capabilities (forward and adjoint).
IDA 	solves initial value problems for differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems.
IDAS 	solves DAE systems and includes sensitivity analysis capabilities (forward and adjoint).
KINSOL 	solves nonlinear algebraic systems.

In addition, SUNDIALS provides a Matlab interface to CVODES, IDAS, and KINSOL - sundialsTB.
